# Name : Transforming COVID19 data
Description : In this checkpoint, we’re going to transform the data in the covid19 file.


Instructions

Let us take the example of the previous super skill after connecting to the COVID-19 file:   ( CSV file ➡️ HERE )

1. Change the name of the dataRep column into Date.

2. Duplicate the Date column in order to be able to slip it. 

3. Split one of the Date columns based on the “/” seperator in order to extract the day, month and year columns that will be very useful for a detailed analysis.

4.Verify that the different field types are correct (check entirely the days, months, years..)

5. Replace the null values with 0 in order to be able to make aggregations later, during the visualization.

6. Rename the columns with meaningful names.
